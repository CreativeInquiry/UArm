#UARM Code
In this repository you will find code that uses openFrameworks to control the arm & code that is run in Processing to control the arm.

##OF
This was tested & confirmed in OpenFrameworks v. 9.0.

If you are a Mac user [follow this tutorial](
http://openframeworks.cc/setup/xcode/) to set up your xcode environment. Create a project using the project generator, which can be found in the folder projectGenerator_osx or it can just be opened like any app. 

Download ofApp.h & ofApp.c, then go into the project you generated and put them in src folder, replacing the ofApp files there.
